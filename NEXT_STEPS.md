The deployment failed as expected. This is because you are deploying an old and broken version of the code.

Please follow these steps to fix the issue:

1.  **Push the latest changes to your GitHub repository.**
    ```bash
    git push
    ```
2.  **Redeploy your project on Vercel.**

The latest version of the code contains the necessary fixes for the deployment to succeed.
