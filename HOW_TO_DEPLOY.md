I cannot deploy the project to Vercel for you as I don't have access to your account.

However, you can easily deploy it yourself by following these steps:

1.  **Push the latest changes to your GitHub repository.**
    You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    git push
    ```

2.  **Vercel will automatically start a new deployment.**
    Once you push the changes, Vercel will detect the new commit and trigger a new build and deployment.

3.  **Check the deployment status on your Vercel dashboard.**
    You can monitor the progress of the deployment on your Vercel dashboard. It should now succeed without any errors.
